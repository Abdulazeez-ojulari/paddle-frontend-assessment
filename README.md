This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First clone project

Second, make sure you have npm installed on your machine

Third, install packages and run the development server:

* Run `npm install`.
* Run `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Available pages:
* `/comingsoon`
* `/about`
* `/blog`
* `/github`

## Libraries

* Axios
* Iconify C.D.N.

## Possible Improvement

* I would make a route to the contact page instead on the fade in effect in the comingsoon page
