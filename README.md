This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

* Node(npm)

## Getting Started

* Clone project
* Install packages and run the development server:
    * Run `npm install`
    * Run `npm run dev`

## Test Application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Available pages:
* `/comingsoon`
* `/about`
* `/blog`
* `/github`

## Libraries

* Axios
* Iconify C.D.N.

## Possible Improvement

* I would make a route to the contact page instead on the fade in effect in the comingsoon page
